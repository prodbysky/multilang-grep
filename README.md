# Grep implementation in many languages

## Why?
This is nothing more than a challenge for me, to try many languages 
and to see if I can use them in a good use case

## Languages that I have implemented simple grep for
 - Rust
 - Go
 - C#
 - C++
 - Kotlin
 - JavaScript
 - Lua
 - Perl
 - Python

## Notes about each language
### Rust:
Rust is my current favourite language however, it is really verbose, 
but with verbosity comes readability, and maintainability, which I enjoy.

### Go:
Go is the polar opposite of Rust, at least for me. the error handling while slightly annoying,
`if err != nil` is kind of getting to me. Otherwise the stdlib is fine.

### C#:
C# has really changed since the last time I have used it (mostly in Unity).
Now the entry point is a simple top level statement, without the boilerplate reminicent of Java.
Other than the initial setup, which I needed to do so I could run C# programs, C#'s stdlib and syntax
is really fun.

### C++:
I really dislike C++. I have been first introduced to it since 5 years ago, and ever since that I have despised it.
The syntax is really noisy (funny coming from a Rust fanboy), error handling is wobbly (I dislike exceptions),
the stdlib is mostly a blend of C and C++, which comes of as weird to me.

### Kotlin:
Kotlin was actually pretty fun, other than the compile times and the default dependency on JWM (I know Kotlin has
a native compiler). The syntax is fun, functional elements of the language don't come of as forced, they don't
seem as a after thought.

### JavaScript:
JavaScript's implementation is definately the most unique when compared to other languages. The requirement of a
callback when reading a file line by line surprised me but when not considering the ecosystem of JS, its
actually not that bad.

### Lua:
Lua's implementation was definately the most interesting to me since getting the length of a table requires a `#`.
Other than that it's a simple barebones language which I have only really used for configuring nvim, and I enjoy a sense
of simplicity in it and go.

### Perl:
I did perl only for variety and the fact that it's syntax is crazy. Other than that it seems like a more exotic
python.

### Python:
Python is the language for quick scripts. It's simplicity and big resemblance to pseudo-code makes it really simple
and fun to program in except if you want to try OOP in it. In my opinion python would be better off without OOP
altogether.
